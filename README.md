# IBQ-Agency-Graph

#### This project was built using Node.Js, Express, Chartist, XLSX, and the Node File System module. 

#### The agency graph is an endpoint I built for IBQ, the need for this came about due to they way we were sending User Statistics to our #### agents. If an agent wanted access their agencies report (i.e. quotes, bind, and pay done broken down by Agent) we were just emailing #### them a PDF with all of that information scattered about. Since our UI can run HTML, an endpoint that consumes an Excel spreadsheet and #### returns HTML seemed like a good choice. 

#### We did not have to alter the code that generates and sends the Excel spreadsheet other than changing the endpoint. To generate the #### charts that the spreadsheet sends I am using Chartist. Chartist takes data for the X Y axis along with the actual user data and ####generates HTML which forms the graph. So my code takes in the spreadsheet, converts it to JSON, loops through the JSON and fills in the #### chart with the data it collected. One snag I ran into was that the chart relies on CSS that chartist provides, which normally wouldn't #### be a problem. However, I needed the response from this API to be one file. So I had the CSS sit in an HTML file wrapped in a style tag #### then I used the File System module to create a variable with all that CSS saved in it. I then just appended the data from the chartist #### function on to that variable and return the variable as the response.
